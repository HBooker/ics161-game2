In Adventures of the Incredible Magneto-tron™ 5000, you play as a sentient horseshoe magnet who is trapped in a hellscape of primitive shapes silhouetted against the horrific landscape of a default backdrop. Some of the primitives react to Magneto-tron™'s electromagnetism, allowing Magneto-tron™ to traverse the perilous terrain in heroic and daring fashion! The smaller magnetables (in red) can be pushed and pulled, while the larger ones (in yellow) are too massive for even Magneto-tron™'s powers and will exert force upon Magneto-tron™ instead.

I want the player to feel like they can approach and solve many different physics puzzles using a small set of core mechanics based on magnetism.
